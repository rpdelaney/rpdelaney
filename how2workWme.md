# Introduction

ðŸ‘‹Hi! My name is Ryan and my pronouns are he/him/his.

I think it's important for us to get to know each other's work styles
to make the most of our collaboration. So, I've written up this "How
to Work with Me" guide to give you a peek into my work preferences,
habits, and quirks. Hopefully, it'll help us work together better
during projects and daily interactions.

This guide isn't meant to be a strict "rulebook", but more like a
handy starting point to help us understand each other. I'm always keen
to learn about your unique styles, too! If you want to chat about
anything or have questions, feel free to reach out.

## My working hours & contacting me

I am in [US Eastern
time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/ann-arbor).

- I am not an early riser, so I tend to start and stop work a bit
  later in the day than most people. I have my non-working hours blocked on my calendar (see below).

- If you need to reach me, use Slack. I check email as little as I can
  get away with. I also make aggressive use of gmail filters.

- When Slack is inoperable, text messaging (SMS or
  [Signal](https://signal.org)) can work as a
  fall-back during a true emergency. I don't expect to get work
  messages via phone, so make sure to identify yourself clearly in
  your message.

### Meetings and calendaring

If the event is not on my calendar, then it *does not exist* in my mind.
_Period_! I will miss my own funeral if it's not on my
calendar.

If you ask me about my availability at a certain time, I am going to
check my calendar before I answer you. That means you can always save a
step by looking at my calendar. (If you need help figuring out how to do
that, I would *love* to help you!)

Feel free to schedule over Focus Time events created by Clockwise.

Adding attendees as "Optional" is useful when their attendance is
welcomed, but not required to achieve the meeting agenda.

## Personality and Communication Style

### Feedback

I live on direct feedback. Please tell me directly and promptly if I've
done something wrong, hurtful, or just awkward etc. I will try hard to
make the conversation as painless for everyone as I can.

Too often, I assume that if nobody is complaining, that means everything
is fine. I'm trying to be better about this, but it's a struggle. On
the flip side, if I don't feel secure that people will tell me when
I'm doing something wrong, then I can get anxious that I don't know
what sort of resentment may be building up in the dark places.

If you think I'm doing a great job, or you've seen improvement from me
on something: tell me, then tell my manager. :o)

### Pugilism, or the appearance thereof

- Take me literally.

If you aren't sure if what I've said should be taken literally, it's
safe to assume that it should be. For instance, my questions are almost
never rhetorical, nor masking some other, "true" meaning behind
subtext.

- I tend to want to discover the truth behind ideas by debating them.

That means that when I encounter ideas that are interesting,
challenging, provocative, or promising, my instinct is to test them with
fire.

This works well when my interlocutor sticks up for their point of view,
because one or both of us learns something, and then I'm fully on
board. (I *want* you to argue back!)

It goes wrong when I don't notice that people around me are feeling
brow-beaten or just want to move on. If that's happening, please make
it known in whatever way is most appropriate and comfortable for you.
Suggesting a different meeting or venue where I can voice my opinions
(maybe a Slack thread? An upcoming retro? etc.) can be very helpful.

Above all else, please remember that I **always** want the project to
succeed more than I want to be right about anything. I know that means I
sometimes have to let it go.

- I may be annoyed, but not *at you*.

I may unintentionally give the impression that I'm annoyed or peeved
with you when I'm not. If I *am* annoyed about something, it's very
probably about the situation we're all in, and it's not directed at
you or anyone else in particular. Please check in with me if you're
concerned about this.

### I'm an "asker"

If you're not familiar with the concept of Ask Culture and Guess
Culture, I encourage you to check out whichever of these resources you
have time and spoons for:

- ['Askers' vs. 'Guessers'](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fnational%2Farchive%2F2010%2F05%2Faskers-vs-guessers%2F340891%2F)
  from *The Atlantic*
- A short [TikTok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@maryrobinettekowal/video/7099897861491412270)
- [My One Topic Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNH64KhPLjM) (~12
  minutes) (includes a few personal anecdotes about my own foibles)

I am an "Ask Culture" person to the core. That means you should feel free
to ask me for help or anything else you might need: because if I am
stretched too thin, I'll simply tell you I can't get to it.

On the other hand, I sometimes forget that everyone else might not find
it so easy to say "no" when they need to. If I ask *you* for something
you can't do, or just don't want to, please try to remember that I am
unaware of the turmoil you might feel over declining, and there will be
*no* hard feelings if you simply tell me you can't.

### I'm an introvert

I love [Donuts](https://www.donut.com/), and I have rarely missed one. However, 
no matter how much I respect and appreciate my colleagues, I generally avoid 
"watercooler" type social events with many people on the call, group lunches and 
drinks after work (in an office setting), etc.

If I politely decline an invitation, it's totally okay to ask again
next time around. I might say yes... once in awhile!

### Peeves

- Dogmatic commitment to tradition; resistance to change *merely*
  because "we've always done it that way".

- Assumptions of bad faith. I would always prefer to be accused of
  being a fuck-up rather than accused of having ill intent.

- Norms and processes that ensure there will be continuous
  interruptions to productive work.

- Mandatory group meetings with sprawling or poorly defined agendas.
