# Introduction

👋Hi! My name is Ryan and my pronouns are he/him/his.

I think it's important for us to get to know each other's work styles to make
the most of our collaboration. So, I've written up this "How to Work with Me"
guide to give you a peek into my work preferences, habits, and quirks.
Hopefully, it'll help us work together better during projects and daily
interactions.

This guide isn't meant to be a strict "rulebook", but more like a handy
starting point to help us understand each other. I'm always keen to learn about
your unique styles, too! If you want to chat about anything or have questions,
feel free to reach out.

## My working hours & contacting me

I am in
[US Eastern time][time].

- I have my default non-working hours blocked on my calendar.

- If you need to reach me quickly, prefer Slack or Teams. I check email
  as little as I can get away with. I also make aggressive use of email
  filters.

- When Slack is inoperable, text messaging (SMS or
  [Signal]) can work as a fall-back during a true
  emergency.

### Meetings and calendaring

If the event is not on my calendar, then it *does not exist* in my mind.
_Period_! I will miss my own funeral if it's not on my calendar.

If you ask me about my availability at a certain time, I am going to check my
calendar before I answer you. That means you can always save a step by looking
at my calendar. (If you need help figuring out how to do that, I would *love*
to help you!)

Adding attendees as "Optional" is useful when their attendance is welcomed, but
not required to achieve the meeting agenda.

## Personality and Communication Style

### Feedback

I live on direct feedback. Please tell me directly and promptly if I've done
something wrong, hurtful, or just awkward etc. I will try hard to make the
conversation as painless for everyone as I can.

Too often, I assume that if nobody is complaining, that means everything is
fine. I'm trying to be better about this, but it's a struggle. On the flip
side, if I don't feel secure that people will tell me when I'm doing something
wrong, then I can get anxious that I don't know what sort of resentment may be
building up in the dark places.

If you think I'm doing a great job, or you've seen improvement from me on
something: tell me, then tell my manager. :o)

### Pugilism, or the appearance thereof

- Take me literally.

If you aren't sure if what I've said should be taken literally, it's safe to
assume that it should be. For instance, my questions are almost never
rhetorical or masking some other meaning in the subtext.

- I tend to discover the truth behind ideas by debating them.

That means that when I encounter ideas that are interesting, challenging,
provocative, or promising, my instinct is to test them with fire.

This works well when my interlocutor sticks up for their point of view, because
one or both of us learns something, and then I'm fully on board. (I *want* you
to argue back!)

It can go wrong if I fail to notice that people around me just want to move on. If
that's happening, please make it known in whatever
way is most appropriate and comfortable for you. Suggesting a different meeting
or venue where I can put my thoughts on the record can be very helpful (maybe a Slack thread? An upcoming retro? etc).

Above all else, please remember that I **always** want the project to succeed
more than I want to be right about anything. I know that means I sometimes have
to let it go.

- I may be annoyed, but not *at you*.

I may unintentionally give the impression that I'm annoyed or peeved with you
when I'm not. If I *am* annoyed about something, it's very probably about the
situation we're all in, and it's not directed at you or anyone else in
particular. Please check in with me if you're concerned about this.

### I'm an "asker"

If you're not familiar with the concept of Ask Culture and Guess Culture, I
encourage you to check out whichever of these resources you have time and
spoons for:

- ['Askers' vs. 'Guessers'][atlantic]
  from *The Atlantic*
- A short
  [TikTok video][tiktok]
- [My One Topic Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNH64KhPLjM) (~12
  minutes) (includes a few personal anecdotes about my own foibles)

I am an "Ask Culture" person to the core. That means you should feel free to
ask me for help or anything else you might need: because if I am stretched too
thin, I'll simply tell you I can't get to it in time to help.

On the other hand, I sometimes forget that not everyone else finds it so
easy to say "no" when they need to. If I ask you for something you can't do,
or just don't want to, please try to remember that there will be no hard feelings if you
simply tell me you can't.

### I'm an introvert

I love [Donuts](https://www.donut.com/), and I have rarely missed one. However,
no matter how much I respect and appreciate my colleagues, I generally avoid
"watercooler" type social events with many people on the call, group lunches
and drinks after work (in an office setting), etc.

If I politely decline an invitation, it's totally okay to ask again next time
around. I might even say yes, once in awhile!

### Peeves

- Dogmatic commitment to tradition; resistance to change *merely* because
  "we've always done it that way".

- Assumptions of bad faith. I would always prefer to be accused of being a
  screw-up rather than accused of having ill intent.

- Norms and processes that ensure there will be continuous interruptions to
  productive work.

- Mandatory group meetings with sprawling or poorly defined agendas.
